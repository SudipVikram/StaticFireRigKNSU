# Static Fire Test Rig from small KNSU based SRMs upto K class

This is an ongoing project under development at the **Society of Amateur Astronomers and Rocketeers Nepal**. The test rig uses a **300Kg** loadcell and a Static Fire Test Kit that houses electronics. It has a concrete base bolted to the rig's base plate. There is an attached motor adapter that can house motors upto 4 inches in diameter. Different size wooden wadding or couplers can be used in the motor adapter for different diameter motors.  The setup is remotely operated from behind a bunker.
